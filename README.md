      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context){
        return Container(
          child: CustomKeyboardKey(
            keyEvent: const CustomKeyboardEvent.clear(),
            borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10),
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(2),
            color: Colors.red,
            child: Center(child: Text('AC')),
          ),
        );
      }
   
      // Set the keyboard height
      @override
      double get height => 230;
   
      // Provide a unique name for the keyboard
      @override
      String get name => 'YOUR_NAME_KEYBOARD';
